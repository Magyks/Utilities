How to git:

By default the master branch will be fetched, to access a different branch place the branch name at the end.

git pull https://github.com/Magyks/Utilities.git <master> <new-branch>

To update the repository:

git add -A
git commit -m "you're message here"
git push https://github.com/Magyks/Utilities.git <master> <new-branch>

will be pushed to working branch

then use git push origin new-branch to push to new-branch
